apache2_base
========

This role provides a bare Apache2 installation on Debian Wheeze systems.
PHP may be installed as well, if *apache2_base_php_enabled* flag is set to true.

Requirements
------------

The role requires Ansible 1.6 and higher due to dependency on apache2_module.
All the platform requirements are listed in the metadata file.

Role Variables
--------------

Below is a list of variables that are available:

Apache server related:
- *apache2_base_extra_packages*: additionall Apache2 related packages that should be
    installed by the role
- *apache2_base_extra_modules*: additionall Apache2 module configuration files that
    should be enabled
- *apache2_base_host*: host part of the Apache2's *Listen* directive
- *apache2_base_port*: port part of the Apache2's *Listen* directive
- *apache2_base_ssl_port*: port part of the Apache2's *Listen* directive for incomming
    SSL connnections
- *apache2_base_prefork_start_servers*: Apache2's *StartServers* directive
- *apache2_base_prefork_min_spare_servers*: Apache2's *MinSpareServers* directive
- *apache2_base_prefork_max_spare_servers*: Apache2's *MaxSpareServers* directive
- *apache2_base_prefork_max_clients*: Apache2's *MaxClients* directive
- *apache2_base_prefork_max_requests_per_child*: Apache2's *MaxRequestsPerChild*
    directive
- *apache2_base_connection_timeout*: Apache2's *Timeout* directive
- *apache2_base_keepalive*: Apache2's *KeepAlive* directive
- *apache2_base_keepalive_max_requests*: Apache2's *KeepAliveTimeout* directive, included
     only if *apache2_base_keepalive* is set to "On"
- *apache2_base_keepalive_timeout*: Apache2's *KeepAliveTimeout* directive, included only
    if *apache2_base_keepalive* is set to "On"
- *apache2_base_rpafproxy_ips*: list of source IPs that RPAF module (if
  enabled) will treat as trusted

modphp related:
- *apache2_base_php_enabled* - if set to True PHP will be installed and configured
- *apache2_base_php_extra_packages*, *apache2_base_php_max_execution_time*, *apache2_base_php_post_max_size*,
    *apache2_base_php_upload_max_filesize*, *apache2_base_php_memory_limit*, *apache2_base_php_file_uploads*,
    *apache2_base_php_short_open_tag*: values of all these directives are used as-is while
    determining the value of their php.ini's counterparts.
- *apache2_base_php_timezone*: translates directly to php.ini's *date.timezone* directive
- *apache2_base_php_open_basedir*: list elements are joined and used as a value for php.ini's
    *open_basedir* directive

php.ini's *disable_functions* option has more complex configuration. There are three
    role variables which relate to it:
- *apache2_base_php_disabled_functions*: it provides global set of foribiden PHP functions. The
    only case when it should have group/host specific override is when the set of
    disabled funcitions is radically different (or none).
- *apache2_base_php_reenabled_functions*: in case when a website/host group/host needs an exception,
    this list allows to reenable only particular function/functions. Use with care!
- *apache2_base_php_extra_disabled_functions*: should be used when there is a need for extra security
    for given group/ website/host and some additionall PHP functions should be disabled.

Please see defaults/main.yml for example values of some of mentioned variables.

All variables have sane defaults, so defining them is optional.

Dependencies
------------

Role requires at least one additionall role that will provide vhost configuration
and content to serve. Please check apache2_examplehost role for more details.
This role alone will not produce usable HTTP server.

Example Playbook
-------------------------

Applying the role is straightforward:

```
- hosts: www-servers
  roles:
    - apache2_base
    - apache2_examplehost
```
